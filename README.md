This is a Python-based command-line tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The program shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of places (shift value), while preserving the case of letters and leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. It features an interactive menu that allows users to choose between encryption, decryption, or exiting the program. To use, simply run the script with Python 3.x, input your message, and specify the desired shift value. The tool is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the fundamentals of cryptography with clean, modular code.
